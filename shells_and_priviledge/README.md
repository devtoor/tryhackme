Having limited user access on a system won't give you the necessary privileges you need to fully exploit it. Privilege escalation is an essential part of any security engagement. This module will give you the necessary skills to enumerate and identify how a system can be made vulnerable. You'll get hands on by fully exploiting a variety of machines, through various vulnerabilities and misconfigurations; kernel exploits, vulnerable services and permission issues are a few of the techniques you'll use to gain system level access.
