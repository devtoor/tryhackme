# Network Security

Learn the basics of passive and active network reconnaissance. Understand how common protocols work and their attack vectors.

---

In this module, we will learn about the different tools and online services for passive reconnaissance and how to leverage various basic programs for active reconnaissance. We will cover Nmap (a network scanning tool) in detail, including discovering live hosts, advanced port-scanning, OS and service version detection, running Nmap scripts and saving scan results. Finally, we will dive into the commonly found protocols to better understand their inner workings and the potential attacks and mitigations.
